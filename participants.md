# Participant Pre-Workshop Preparation

    - [Zoom Client](https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting)

    - [GitHub](https://github.com/) for sharing source code.

## Collaboration Tools

We will have facilitators who can guide you in operating these tools on the day of the workshop. But it would be helpful if you familiarize yourself with these tools as well. 

1. We will be using Zoom's [remote control](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362673-Requesting-or-giving-remote-control) feature to work on code together.

2. For **remote coding** with the facilitators online, we will be using:

    - [Cyber-Dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org/)


3. For **doodling** and **drawing**, we will be using:

    - [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)

If in doubt, do contact the organizers via email.
